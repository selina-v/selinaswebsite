# In this file, I'm going to explain my code

### Purpose & Description: 

The purpose of this website is because I want to create my own magic 8 ball that I can easily access. During my childhood I never had a Magic 8 Ball before and making this website is like giving a gift to my youngerself. In my website you can access Magic 8 Ball where it'll answer your question, but the question must be a yes or no question or less it won't be able to answer your question. 

### How to Use the Website:

When you first enter my website you can click on the link that would take you to the Magic 8 Ball. Then user could input their yes or no question into the text box. Once they press enter, under the text box the website would give a random answer just like a regular Magic 8 Ball. There's also a button next to it where user can clear their whole text without using backspace. Underneath it all there's another button where it'll take them back to the main page of this website. Depending on the answer, the image changes expression that matches with it.

**this is where I'll add my hyperlink**

### File Structure:

###### HTML: 
website.html is where I code the main layout page (Title, hyperlink, and the image,) of the website. 8ball.html is where I set up the layout (Title, buttons, the images, and input box) for the main Magic 8 Ball website.
###### CSS: 
style.css is where I organize and style my website. For example I would give an id (ex: id = id would be #id) or a class (ex: class = class would be .class) to a banner landmark and change the text colors, adjust the position (of image, button, title, text boc, etc) and add shadows, etc. 
###### JS:
check.js contains the function checkAnswer() to see if the user input is an yes or no question. If it is then it'll randomize an answer but if not then it won't generate and pop a message "that's not a question I can answer".
clear.js contains the function clearInput() to create a button that let users clear all their input quickly without using backspace.
goback.js contains function goBack() that creates a button that let user go back to main page when pressed.
